For the purposes of JS, the browser bunches all the elements in the page into an object: the Document Object Model or DOM.

This is nothing but all the html content and other methods and needed functions bunched in an object as if

const DOM {
	<head> {
		...
	}
	<body> {
		...
	}
}

More or less.

We can query stuff in the page using the DOM

	document.location.href -> will grab the content in href (the url) stored inside the location class, inside the document object.

We can also query the DOM by using the browser syntax to be more efficient:

	document.getElementsByClassName('className')[0]; -> this will grab the first element in the array 'className' stored in the DOM object, AS AN OBJECT.

And we can be very specific:

	document.getElementsByClassName('topics')[2].children[0].text -> this will get the element number [2] in the array, which being another object will have sub-elements. Then pick the first child element and output only the text.
