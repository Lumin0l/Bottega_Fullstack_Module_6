Most common elements:

	Frames
	Classifiers
	Stereotypes
	Comments
	Dependencies
	Features (which are also called Properties)


-> Frames:

	They help you encapsulate your view components. They tell what the app does in context.

	Different types:
		- act 	= activity
		- class = class
		- cmp 	= components
		- dep 	= deployment
		- sd 	= interaction
		- pkg 	= package
		- stm 	= state machine
		- uc 	= use case

-> Classifiers

	A way to identify components. They classify. They are high level information and they are standard.
	A classifier describes a set of instances that have common behavioral and structural features (operations and attributes, respectively). 

	    - Class
    	- Component
    	- Datatype
    	- Interface
    	- Node
    	- Signal
    	- Subsystem
    	- Use Case

-> Comments / Notes

	They are used to explain things in a non formalized way. In a way, they are a means to clarify uml info outside of the uml convention.
	They are a great way to explain the uml stuff either to people who aren't used to this or to people outside the dev process.

-> Dependencies

	Denotes coupling. they are done with a dotted line with an open arrow. Show what parts of the aplication need other parts or outside APIs.

-> Features / Properties

	Represent attributes of a particular element. They follow a naming convention so they can be understood.
