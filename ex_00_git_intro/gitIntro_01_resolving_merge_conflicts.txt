In case you and a coworker changed the same code and you attempted a merge, it would trigger a conflict.

To fix the conflict, you need to use the conflict resolver, depends on plugins and so on, but the fefault consists on:
	Showing your commit code under the name "HEAD"
	Showing the code from the other commit under the name of the main branch.

	You need to delete all the content you don't want, to pick one of the options. Save it, add, commit, push and done.
